Setting IICE sampler (set IICE clock) to '/rtl/CommsFPGA_top_0/behavioral/PROCESSOR_INTERFACE_INST/clk16x' for IICE named 'IICE' (previous value: '')
Instrumenting design `m2s010_som' in directory C:\Users\gcallsen\Documents\Projects\FPGA\v1_6-082417-DebugCol\synthesis\rev_debug1
The target device family is 'SmartFusion2' (and considered a ProAsic3-based family; hence we do care about UJTAG / UJTAG_WRAPPER instances).
The design does not contain a UJTAG_WRAPPER instance.
OK, the design does not contain a UJTAG instance.
