Setting IICE sampler (sampledepth) to 4096 for IICE named 'IICE'(previous value: 128)
Setting IICE sampler (set IICE clock) to '/rtl/CommsFPGA_top_0/bit_clk2x' for IICE named 'IICE' (previous value: '')
Instrumenting design `m2s010_som' in directory C:\Users\gcallsen\Documents\GitHubBF\PPI.SOC.FPGAv2.0\synthesis\PHY_2_Debug
The target device family is 'SmartFusion2' (and considered a ProAsic3-based family; hence we do care about UJTAG / UJTAG_WRAPPER instances).
The design does not contain a UJTAG_WRAPPER instance.
OK, the design does not contain a UJTAG instance.
