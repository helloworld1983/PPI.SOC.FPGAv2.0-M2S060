Initializing High-Effort Timing-Driven Placement ...
While analyzing gated clock network, ambiguities have been found on gates CommsFPGA_top_0/PROCESSOR_INTERFACE_INST/REG_READ_PROC.un18_read_reg_en_i_o2_RNI2COS:Y, CommsFPGA_top_0/PROCESSOR_INTERFACE_INST/read_reg_en_RNIFH0F1:Y.
The timing models of these gates have been simplified for Static Timing Analysis.
