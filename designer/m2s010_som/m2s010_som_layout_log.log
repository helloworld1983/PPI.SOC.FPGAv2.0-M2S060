Initializing High-Effort Timing-Driven Placement ...
While analyzing gated clock network, ambiguities have been found on gates CommsFPGA_top_0/PROCESSOR_INTERFACE_INST/REG_READ_PROC.un18_read_reg_en:Y, CommsFPGA_top_0/PROCESSOR_INTERFACE_INST/un1_apb3_reset_0:Y.
The timing models of these gates have been simplified for Static Timing Analysis.
