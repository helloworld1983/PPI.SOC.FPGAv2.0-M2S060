* Can't call UART_hex from ISR. 
* Changed ping to 10.0.0.13.
* Added ETH0 IP:...

2018-03-01
* Modified "\SF2\drivers_config\sys_config\sys_config_mddr_define.h" to use clock settings 
    compatible with Bluefin Innovations FPGA ver 2.0. UARTs and System Tick are now correct.

Tasks:
  prvTimerTask, Manage timer events and callbacks.
  prvIPTask, Receive IP commands, send and receive ICMP, TCP & UDP packets.
  prvIdleTask, Run when nothing else is running.
  GPIO_BlinkTask, Blink a couple LEDs on the StarterKit.
  prvTxCbTask, Free available NetworkPacket Desciptors after they have been sent to MAC's tx buffer.
  prvEMACHandlerTask, TBD
  
  Basic execution so far:
  * Initialize GPIO pins and setup GPIO_BlinkTask() to toggle the LEDs every second.
  * Initialize UART0 & 1, including mutexes. Send "Intelligent Rail (c)2018" to UART0.
  * Initialize IP Stack using +TCP, this instantiates: prvIPTask(), prvTxCbTask() & prvEMACHandlerTask().
  * prvIPTask() calls vApplicationIPNetworkEventHook() whenever the network is setup and ready,
        I'm currently using this hook to send a ping to 192.168.1.15 (my PC). Before this can 
        happen however, the ARP table for 192.168.1.15 must be populated with its MAC address, 
        so the first thing to come out is actually an ARP Request.
